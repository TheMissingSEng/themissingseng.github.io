## Create a Repository

1. Create a new repo

   ```bash
   git init --initial-branch=main
   ```

2. Write a simple "Hello World" program

   ```bash
   #include <iostream>
   int main()
   {
       std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. Compile it

   ```bash
   g++ hello.cpp
   ```

4. Make sure it runs

   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

   Then see what has changed in the repo with this command

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

5. Now stage the source code

   ```bash
   git add hello.cpp
   ```

6. Commit the changes

   ```bash
   # -m adds a commit message, make sure it is informative!
   git commit -m "Initial Commit"
   ```

7. Create a git ignore file

   ```bash
   echo "a.out" > .gitignore
   ```

8. To view the history of the repo

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   Shows who made what changes and when

9. Push the repo to remote repository

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin sample_URL.com && git push
   ```

10. Get the latest updates from the remote repository, but do not modify head

    ```bash
    git fetch
    ```

11. Get the latest updates from the remote repository
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

## Cloning Repositories

Say you need to collaborate with another developer. In this case you will clone their repo onto your system so that you can make your changes. And you will do this on a separate branch

1. Clone the Repo

   ```bash
   git clone collaborator_URL.com

   # Create a new Branch for your changes
   git checkout -b Your_Branch
   ```

2. Make your changes and check what files you modified

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Check if your files have been tracked and then Commit and Push

   ```bash
   git add <files you created>
   or
   git add .

   #check your working area to make sure the files are tracked
   git status

   #push all your changes
   git commit -a -m "Created files X,Y,Z and changed A,B,C"

   # You would ideally be working on your own branch: Denoted as Your_Branch
   git push origin Your_Branch

   ```

4. Validate your changes with
   ```bash
   git log
   ```
